# Client Side Boilerplate
> This is a grunt based boilerplate that helps you up and run your project.

## Getting Started
This boilerplate requires Grunt `>=0.4.0`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this Boilerpate with this command:

```sh
$ grunt
```

Once it's up and running, it will open your default browser on this link:
```url
http://127.0.0.1:8080
```
Now you are ready to get into work. no need to configure anything. it's already done for you. and of course, you are free to edit as it suits you.

> The pre directory is where your preprocessor assets goes, and it will be rendered to post directory. and that's it.

### It includes some of grunt modules like:
* [grunt-contrib-sass](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-sass) to compile Sass files
* [grunt-contrib-watch](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch) for watching the changes and autoload
* [grunt-contrib-clean](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-clean) for cleaning up files
* [grunt-contrib-connect](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-connect) to build a server while working
* [grunt-contrib-copy](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-copy) It's not used yet but I've included it in case you need to make some changes in the structure
* [grunt-contrib-imagemin](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-imagemin) to optimize the images size

* [Bootstrap-rtl](https://github.com/morteza/bootstrap-rtl) as add-on to Bootstrap for RTL support 
* [webfontloader](https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader) for loading the vendor fonts
